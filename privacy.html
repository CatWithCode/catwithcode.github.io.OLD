    <h3>This Website is hosted on GitHub and published with GitHub-Pages. This website at the end is just static HTML documents inside a GitHub-Repository displayed in your browser. This Website is obviously open source and the code can be viewed as a Code-Repository:</h3>

    <h3>GitHub itself as the host can collect stuff. Github themselves can create cookies in your browser. To know what they do look at their cookie policy and information. I don't do anything with cookies. I coded this blog myself without anything external. Thanks to that I know exactly what my HTML, CSS and JS files can do. Cookies are something they cannot do. What your browser dose on its own, like caching or similar, I don't know and I don't care. For more Information about the GitHub-Website and what they do look at there main site directly. Here are some Links about that. For more information about GitHub do your own research.:</h3>

    <h3>On GitHub, the only information I can see at the end are the information every developer on GitHub can see when someone is looking at there GitHub Repositorys. This entire page is nothing more then a simple GitHub Repository but you load the HTML files directly form it. Or let me say it differently: Welcome to my GitHub-Repository "catwithcode.github.io". If a Link on this Blog goes to a external website, then there rules count at this point and I have no control over the content there and what they do with your data! If your browser is configured in a certain way it even can load links into memory without you even clicking on them. If that's the case that's on you. Content on the linked pages can change in the future! That is not in my hand! If a link goes to a bad location in the future just send me a message (look at the "CONTACT"-Page for more information) and I remove the link from the blog as fast as possible.</h3>
    <h1>I don't care about you and your data! I only can see GitHub-Repository user and visitor information. That just comes with hosting a website on GitHub. Leaf me alone.</h1>
    <h3>In the past, I used the google search console to force search engines to index my website. For some reason they didn't find my website before. Now most search engines do it automatically because they know this website exists and I don't need to do it manually anymore. That means I removed the Google-HTML-Tag from this website which removes my ability to view the Google-Search-Console information on this website from now on. I don't know how long it will take google to pick this change up and block my access (Small update: I needed to remove my "Property" at the Google-Search-Console for some reason for it to completely disable. And it lets me readd the property, even though the HTML-Tag and File stuff is removed for quite some time now. IDK. what's happening there but I removed my "Property" there just to make sure.). I don't care about this information and only really used it for indexing. I wanted to be as open as possible anyway. To see the old privacy page before the change, use the Github commit history for this HTML-File:</h3>
