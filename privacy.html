    <h3>This Website is hosted on GitHub and published with GitHub-Pages. I don't do anything to collect anything extra! This website at the end is just static HTML documents displayed in your browser. This Website is obviously open source and the code can be viewed as a Code-Repository:</h3>

    <h3>GitHub itself as the host can collect stuff. For more Information about that part look on the GitHub-Website itself. Here are some (but NOT every) Link for more information:</h3>

    <h3>The only information I can see at the end are the information every developer on GitHub can see when someone is looking at there GitHub Repositorys. This entire page is nothing more then a simple GitHub Repository but you load the HTML files directly form it. Or let me say it differently: Welcome to my GitHub-Repository "catwithcode.github.io". If a Link on this Blog goes to a external website, then there rules count at this point and I have no control over the content there and what they do with your data! If your browser is configured in a certain way it even can load links into memory without you even clicking on them. If that's the case that's on you. Content on the linked pages can change in the future! That is not in my hand! If a link goes to a bad location in the future just send me a message (look at the "CONTACT"-Page for more information) and I remove the link from the blog as fast as possible. At the end there is to say: I don't care about you and your data and don't collect anything myself. Leaf me alone.</h3>
