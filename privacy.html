    <h3>The only information I can see at the end are the information every developer on GitHub can see when someone is looking at there GitHub Repositorys. This entire page is nothing more then a simple GitHub Repository but you load the HTML files directly form it. Or let me say it differently: Welcome to my GitHub-Repository "catwithcode.github.io". If a Link on this Blog goes to a external website, then there rules count at this point and I have no control over the content there! Content on the linked pages can change in the future! That is not in my hand! If a link goes to a bad location in the future just send me a message (look at the "CONTACT"-Page for more information) and I remove the link from the blog as fast as possible.</h3>
