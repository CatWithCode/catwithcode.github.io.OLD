    <h1>Welcome to my Blog!</h1>    
    <h3>I'm a girl from Germany and work as a Software Developer. I love programming and tinkering. Thanks to this I discover a lot of random stuff in my daily life. From modding old flip phones to installing an obscure Linux Distro. I always wanted a way to document my findings secure and discoverable and that is why you are probably here now. Have fun!</h3>      
    <h3>I am really bad (and really hate) HTML and CSS so.... enjoy the cringe :P.</h3>
    <h3>This Website is just a simple GitHub-Repository with static HTML-Files. So yea. I don't collect anything and to see what GitHub collects them self and allow me to see, look on the GitHub Website itself and the "Privacy"-Page in this Repository.</h3>
    <h3>So that's all. To get to the content click on "BLOG" in the Top bar. If you are searching for something use CTRL+F or use the search feature of your Browser. Have fun!</h3>
