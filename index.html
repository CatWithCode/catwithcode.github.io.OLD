    <h1>Welcome to my Blog!</h1>    
    <h3>I'm a girl from Germany and work as a Software Developer. I love programming and tinkering. Thanks to this I discover a lot of random stuff in my daily life. From modding old flip phones to installing an obscure Linux Distro. I always wanted a way to document my findings securely and discoverable and that is why you are probably here now. Have fun!</h3>
