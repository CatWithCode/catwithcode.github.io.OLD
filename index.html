    <h1>Welcome to my Blog!</h1>    
    <h3>I'm a girl from Germany and work as a Software Developer. I love programming and tinkering. Thanks to this I discover a lot of random stuff in my daily life. From modding old flip phones to installing an obscure Linux Distro. I always wanted a way to document my findings secure and discoverable and that is why you are probably here now. Have fun!</h3>      
    <h3>I am really bad (and really hate) HTML, CSS and JS so.... enjoy the cringe :P.</h3>

    <h1>IF YOU TRY ANYTHING WRITTEN ON THIS BLOG YOU ARE DOING IT AT YOUR OWN RISK! IT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS! DON'T COME TO ME CRYING IF SOMETHING WENT WRONG. THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM AND ONLY YOURS!</h1>
