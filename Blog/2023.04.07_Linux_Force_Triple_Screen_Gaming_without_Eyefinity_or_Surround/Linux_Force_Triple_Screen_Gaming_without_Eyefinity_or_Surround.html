    <h1>Forcing Triple Screen Gaming without Eyefinity or Surround on Linux</h1>    
    <h3>I wanted to run my triple screen gaming setup on Linux, unfortunately I had to do a lot of research to find a way to do it. I tried several desktops (GNOME, Wayfire, ...) and the only one with the performance AND configuration for it was KDE. After a lot of research I wrote a KWin script that changes the position and size of the focus window. It is extremely simple. For most games I just use Gamescope to force them into the resolution. Very often I have to change some things in the games config files for the resolution and the FOV (standard ultrawide / triple screen gaming stuff LOL :S).</h3>

    <h3>Also: Why is the documentation for KWin scripts so bad? It is actually hard to find things and APIs... .</h3>
